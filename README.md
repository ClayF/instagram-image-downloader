# php-instagram-scraper
Scrapes images off Instagram

### Introduction
This thing is not 100% polished. I haven't tested it much. It was just a quick thing I did to download all my Instagram photos with the upload date intact.

Will be looking into speeding up the download times by downloading the files synchronously.

### Usage

```sh
$ php instagram_scraper.php <username>
```

### Requirements

This script requires the following installed:
* PHP
* cURL
